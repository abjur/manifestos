# manifestos

Manifestos from ABJ about open data and public policy.

## Description

This is a book built using [`abjBook`](https://github.com/abjur/abjBook) package. It contains manifestos from ABJ about subjects we believe are important to make good court administration and public policy. All texts are in portuguese language.

## Files

- Most files are used to build and deploy the book. 
- `index.Rmd`, `NAMESPACE`, `DESCRIPTION` and all files ending with `.sh` ore `.yml` are configuration files.
- `bibliography`, `imgs` and `latex` contain images and bibliography files.
- Actually, only the `01-dados.Rmd` file contains relevant text.
